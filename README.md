### What is Smapshot mobile application?
This codebase is the work of two master thesis students where the focus is on developing a mobile application prototype with the feature of retaking historical photographs. Rephotography allows us to compare the past with the present. A part from development, this thesis also includes carrying out a user-centered design process (UCD) and geospatial research.

For now, this work is only available for Android and not iOS. The mobile app includes two photographs to retake in Yverdon: one test photo and one from Smapshot archives.

## Permissions
The mobile application requires three permissions:
* Location - to display your current location and photos to retake nearby.
* Camera - to take photos with your camera.
* Storage - to store photos captured.

## Contributors
* Christoffer Karlsson - master thesis student
* Alfred Hirschfeld - master thesis student
